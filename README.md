## üößüë∑‚Äç In progress

### 9/8/2019

* Scraper: module functional for one site
  + scraped items go to diskdb database
* API: serve db items in `api/items` 
* Runner: execute when server restarted ( `server.js` ), only once per day using db logs `date_last_run` 
  + but still have to trigger a server restart/deploy to re-run
* UI: basic view

TODO: 

* RUNNER: trigger script through a scheduler, instead of server start
* UI: continue work on items view
* DEPLOY: make API work through Netlify functions
  + `/api/items` not accessible from Netlify
